## Description
In this project I realized all the process that involves making data analytics for a complex company documented and published by Microsoft as it is AdventureWorks

* I had the opportunity to understand the database schema in SQL Server using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio,

* I created the diagrams entity relationship of the tables of the different areas of the company,

* I built advanced SQL queries to prepare the data needed to develop AdventureWorks Data Analytics,

* I explored and transformed the data into connected Power BI Power Query from SQL Server, to build an analytical data model of AdventureWorks.

* I enriched the data model with Power BI DAX to create new information that answers many questions in the areas of Purchasing, Production, Warehouse, Sales, Human Resources and Customers of the company AdventureWorks.

* I will develop the visualization of information with modern, intuitive and high-impact reports in Power BI to tell the history of the company with data and to understand the past, present and future of management.
