## Description
I analyzed data from 365 to understand how students learn and engage on their platform.
Also, I created a professional panel in Tableau entirely from scratch, including:
key performance indicators and powerful visualizations with real analytical potential.
Finally, this lab gave me the possibility to get valuable business information to help a company grow and develop.

## Sections

* First understand the case study by analyzing the commitment of 365 students by defining key parameters.
* Creating questions to monitor with our control panel.
* I used the Student Engagement Database and used SQL to extract relevant information from it.
* Then came the best part of building the control panel in Tableau.
* I built individual charts and then combined them into a panel.


## Conclusion

One of the most exciting aspects of the Customer Behavior Analysis is identify potential customers, mejorar la retenciÃ³n de clientes y aumentar la satisfacciÃ³n del cliente.
