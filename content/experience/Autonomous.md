### Description

I have devoted significant time and effort to developing and implementing a number of data science projects that have enriched my understanding and skills in this dynamic field. These projects have been designed to address real-world problems and apply advanced data analysis, modeling and visualization techniques to obtain valuable ideas and concrete solutions. Here are some of the most representative projects I have undertaken:

> **Customer Segmentation and Personalized Recommendations:**
I implemented clustering and collaborative filtering techniques to segment customers on an e-commerce platform. This enabled more accurate and personalized product recommendations, improving customer experience and increasing conversion rates.

> **Predicting Buying Behaviors in E-Commerce**
In an effort to understand and predict purchasing behaviors at British Airways, I played the data scientist role that involved the machine learning app. By leveraging historical booking data and user characteristics, I developed predictive models that identified patterns that generated personalized recommendations. This project sought to increase the relevance of recommendations to users through identifying the most important predictive features.

> **Sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
As part of my experience in data analysis, I have conducted a sentiment analysis project for British Airways using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing text data from reviews posted on a web portal, I could identify emotional patterns and opinions in customer reviews. This allowed us to better understand the perception of their customer experience and take informed measures to improve customer satisfaction and strategic decision making.

Each project has been an opportunity for learning and growth, allowing me to apply my knowledge in programming, statistical analysis, data cleaning and transformation, as well as in the implementation of machine learning algorithms. Through these projects, I have demonstrated my ability to address complex challenges and generate practical solutions using data-based approaches.

###### _I want to make it clear that some of these projects are part of a virtual experience program as a data scientist promoted by Forage and I have never worked for these companies I mentioned_.
