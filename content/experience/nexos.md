## Analysis and design of information system for the process of health entity contracts
### Context and Objective

As a functional analyst at Nexos Software, I was responsible for analyzing existing business processes to identify pain points and areas for improvement. The objective was to define the functional requirements of a new structured information system to optimize the internal management of health institution contracts.

### My Role and Contribution

I conducted comprehensive business process analysis through interviews with key stakeholders, defined detailed functional requirements, and collaborated on database design. I also created user interface prototypes that enhanced user experience.

### Results and Achievements
I have identified key areas for improvement in business processes, which allows the development of a more efficient workflow-based system. I designed an easy to use interface that optimized the workflow by 100% and allows control of the entire legal contracts process.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
The main challenge was the complexity of existing processes, requiring a thorough evaluation to optimize each component without disrupting current operations. I learned to balance business needs with system limitations, ensuring a functional and scalable solution.
