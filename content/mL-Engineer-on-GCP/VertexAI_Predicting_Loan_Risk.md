## Description:
The hands-on lab allowed me to do lab activities in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demonstration environment.
 In this lab, I used Vertex AI to train and serve a machine learning model to predict loan risk with a tabular dataset.

## Steps:
* 1 Created a Vertex AI project and a dataset.
* 2 Uploaded the loan risk dataset to the dataset.
* 3 I used AutoML to train a machine learning model to predict loan risk.
* 4 I evaluated the model performance using a confusion matrix.
* 5 I deployed the model to an endpoint.
* 6 I made predictions using the model..

## Challenges:

* I encountered some challenges when uploading the dataset to Vertex AI. The dataset was large and took a long time to upload.
* I also encountered some challenges when tried get SML Bearer Token to allow the pipelin to authenticate.

## Reflection:

* I learned a lot about Vertex AI and machine learning with AutoML.
* I also learned how to troubleshoot problems and think critically.
* I would recommend this lab to anyone who is interested in learning about machine learning and Vertex AI.
