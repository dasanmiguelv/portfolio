## Description
In this lab created by `Ligency Ventures Main`, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer** in the data science department of a retail store. Recent promotional campaigns did not generate the desired result and there seems to be an error with customers' avatars. The CEO gave us a task to help the marketing team and help them with customer segmentation to better tailor store promotions. As a machine learning engineer, my goal was to find the customer groups most likely to interact with specific products and provide that data with a detailed report to the marketing team to optimize promotional campaigns.

## Outcome

As a result of this model I presented an executive summary that allows the company to optimize customer segmentation to present effective promotional campaigns.
This summary shows the findings identified and the recommendations given for each of them. **[See report](https://github.com/dasanmiguelv/clustering/tree/main/Report).**
