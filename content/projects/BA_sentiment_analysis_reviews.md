## Description
As a data scientist at BA, it was my job to apply my analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

The first task was focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.
Once I had the dataset, I needed to prepare it. The data was very messy and contained purely text and some emojis. 
I performed data cleanup in order to prepare the data for analysis, using techniques to remove punctuation marks, emojis and stop words, tokenize and lemmatize. 

When the data were clean, perform my own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, I applied topic modelling, sentiment analysis and wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
# Outcome

As a result of the analysis present a summary with findings containing visualizations and metrics to explain key points about what customers were talking about the customer experience and British Airways.
